This homework assignment involves exercises about layer models from 
Chapter 3 in _Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast_.

* Undergraduate students should do exercises 2--3.
* Graduate students should do all three exercises 1--3.

The homework is due at the beginning of class on Monday Sept. 4.
You have the choice of doing this homework either:

* As traditional homework, in which case you don't need these files and you can
  turn your homework in at the beginning of class on Sept. 4.
* As RMarkdown, in which case you can use the file `homework_01.Rmd` as a 
  template, knit your completed homework into a PDF file, and turn in the assignment
  by committing all of your changes to the repository and pushing them to github
  by the start of class on Sept. 4.

I advise using git to commit changes frequently as you work and push those commits
to github.
