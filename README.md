This homework assignment involves exercises about layer models from 
Chapter 3 in _Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast_.

* Undergraduate students should do exercises 2--3.
* Graduate students should do all three exercises 1--3.

The homework is due at the beginning of class on Monday Sept. 4.
You have the choice of doing this homework either:

* As traditional homework, in which case you don't need these files and you can
  turn your homework in at the beginning of class on Sept. 4.
  
* As RMarkdown, in which case you can use the file `homework_01.Rmd` as a 
  template.
  
    If you turn in the homework as RMarkdown:
    
    * Clone a local copy of the file repository from github.
    * In your local repository, answer the exercises in the template
      `homework_01.Rmd`.
    * When you are done, knit your `.Rmd` file into a PDF file.
    * Use git to commit your changes (including the edits to `homework_01.Rmd`
      and the new PDF file) to your local git repository.
    * Push the changes from your local git repository to github.

         The last changes that you push before the due date (start of class
         on Monday Sept. 4) will be graded.

I advise using git to commit changes frequently as you work and push those commits
to github.
