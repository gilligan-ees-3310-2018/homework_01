# Instructions

The exercises from Chapter 3, below, are not to do for the lab
but are homework exercises. You have a choice:

* You can do the exercises out of the book like regular homework and
  turn them in at the beginning of class on Monday, Sept. 4.

* You can do them using RMarkdown and turn them by submitting them 
  electronically on GitHub by the start of class on Monday, Sept. 4.
  
    To submit the homework electronically, 
  
    * Clone a local copy of the file repository from github.
    * In your local repository, answer the exercises in the template
      `homework_01.Rmd`.
    * When you are done, knit your `.Rmd` file into a PDF file.
    * Use git to commit your changes (including the edits to `homework_01.Rmd`
      and the new PDF file) to your local git repository.
    * Push the changes from your local git repository to github.

         The last changes that you push before the due date (start of class
         on Monday Sept. 4) will be graded.

It is your choice how to do them. Either way is acceptable and will get equal
credit.

# Exercises from Chapter 3

For the following exercises, use the following numbers:

* I~solar~ = 1350 W/m^2^
* $\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8}$
* $\alpha = 0.30$
* $\varepsilon = 1.0$

```{r layer_model_constants}
I_solar = 1350
alpha = 0.30
sigma = 5.67E-8
epsilon = 1
```

## Worked Example for One-Layer Atmosphere

> **A One-Layer Model.** 

```{r one_layer_figure, fig.cap = "An energy diagram for a planet with one pane of glass for an atmosphere. The intensity of heat from visible light is $(1 - \\alpha) I_{solar} / 4$."}
make_layer_diagram(1)
```

> a) Write the energy budgets for the atmospheric layer, for the ground, and for
> the Earth as a whole.

**Answer:** Start at the top, at the boundary to sapce, and work downward:

* At the boundary to space, $I_{1,up} = (1 - \alpha) I_{solar} / 4$.

* At the atmospheric layer, $I_{1,up} + I_{1,down} = I_{ground,up}$

* At the ground, $(1 - \alpha) I_{solar} + I_{1,down} = I_{ground,up}$

We also know that

* $I_{1,up} = I_{1,down} = \varepsilon \sigma T_{1}^4$

* $I_{ground,up} = \sigma T_{ground}^4$


> b) Manipulate the budget for the Earth as a whole to obtain the temperature 
> T~1~ of the atmospheric layer. Does this part of the exercise seem familiar in 
> any way? Does the term ring any bells?

**Answer:** 

$$(1 - \alpha) I_{solar} / 4 = I_{1,up} = \sigma T_{1}^4$$

$$(1 - \alpha) I_{solar} / 4 \varepsilon \sigma = T_{1}^4$$

$$T_{1} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{(1 - \alpha) I_{solar}}{4 \varepsilon \sigma}}$$

This is familiar, because it's the same as the formula for the bare-rock temperature.

```{r layer_1_temperature}
I_1_up = (1 - alpha) * I_solar / 4
T_1 = (I_1_up / (epsilon * sigma))^0.25
```

From the algebraic solution, we expect T~1~ to be `r format_md(((1 - alpha) * I_solar / (4 * epsilon * sigma))^0.25, digits = 3)` K.
From the R code above, we get T~1~ = `r format_md(T_1, digits = 3)` K.

> c) Now insert the value you found for T~1~ into the budget for atmospheric 
> layer 1 to obtain the temperature of the ground, T~ground~.

**Answer:** 

* $I_{ground} = I_{1,up} + I_{1,down} = 2 \times I_{1,up}$
* $\varepsilon \sigma T_{ground}^4 = 2 \varepsilon \sigma T_{1}^4$
* $T_{ground}^4 = 2 T_{1}^4$
* $T_{ground} = \sqrt[4]{2} \times T_{1}$

```{r ground_temperature}
I_1_down = I_1_up
I_ground = I_1_up + I_1_down
T_ground = (I_ground / (epsilon * sigma))^0.25
```

From the algebraic solution, we get T~ground~ = `r format_md(2^0.25 * T_1, digits = 3)` K and from the R code above, we get T~ground~ = `r format_md(T_ground, digits = 3)` K.
## Exercise 3.1 (Grad. students only)

> **The moon with no heat transport.** The Layer Model assumes that the 
> temperature of the body in space is all the same. This is not really very 
> accurate, as you know that it is colder at the poles than it is at the equator. 
> For a bare rock with no atmosphere or ocean, like the moon, the situation is 
> even worse because fluids like air and water are how heat is carried around on
> the planet. So let us make the other extreme assumption, that there is no heat 
> transport on a bare rock like the moon. Assume for comparability that the 
> albedo of this world is 0.30, same as Earthâ€™s. 
>
> What is the equilibrium temperature of the surface of the moon, on the equator, 
> at local noon, when the sun is directly overhead? (Hint: First figure out the 
> intensity of the local solar radiation I~solar~)

**Answer:** put your answer here ...

> What is the equilibrium temperature on the dark side of the moon?

## Exercise 3.2

> **A Two-Layer Model.** Insert another atmospheric layer into the model, just 
> like the first one. The layer is transparent to visible light but a blackbody 
> for infrared.

```{r two_layer_figure, fig.cap = "An energy diagram for a planet with two panes of glass for an atmosphere. The intensity of absorbed visible light is $(1 - \\alpha) I_{solar} / 4$."}
make_layer_diagram(2)
```

> a) Write the energy budgets for both atmospheric layers, for the ground, and 
> for the Earth as a whole, like we did for the One-Layer Model.

**Answer:** put your energy budgets here...

> b) Manipulate the budget for the Earth as a whole to obtain the temperature 
> T~2~ of the top atmospheric layer, labeled Atmospheric Layer 2 in the figure 
> above. Does this part of the exercise seem familiar in any way? Does the term 
> ring any bells?

```{r ex_3_2_b}
# Put your R code here to answer the question
```

**Answer:** put the temperature T~2~ here...

> c) Insert the value you found for T~2~ into the energy budget for layer 2, and 
> solve for the temperature of layer 1 in terms of layer 2. How much bigger is 
> T~1~ than T~2~?

```{r ex_3_2_c}
# Put your R code here to answer the question
```

**Answer:** put the temperature T~1~ here....

> d) Now insert the value you found for T~1~ into the budget for atmospheric 
> layer 1 to obtain the temperature of the ground, T~ground~. Is the greenhouse 
> effect stronger or weaker because of the second layer?

# Put your R code here to answer the question
```

**Answer:** put your answer here...

## Exercise 3.3

```{r nuclear_winter_diagram, fig.cap="An energy diagram for a planet with an opaque pane of glass for an atmosphere. The intensity of absorbed visible light is $(1 - \\alpha) I_{solar} / 4$."}
make_nuclear_winter_diagram()
```

> **Nuclear Winter.** Let us go back to the One-Layer Model but change it so 
> that the atmospheric layer absorbs visible light rather than allowing it to 
> pass through (See the figure above). This could happen if the upper atmosphere 
> were filled with dust. For simplicity, assume that the albedo of the Earth 
> remains the same, even though in the real world it might change with a dusty 
> atmosphere.>  What is the temperature of the ground in this case?
